Here is the Python code for the function `correct_bracketing_advanced`. This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks the top of the stack and if the opening bracket of the same type is found, it pops it from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means all brackets are correctly nested and matched.

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    bracket_map = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in bracket_map.values():  # if it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket in bracket_map.keys():  # if it's a closing bracket
            if stack == [] or bracket_map[bracket] != stack.pop():
                return False
    return stack == []
```

This code is efficient as it only traverses the string once, making it O(n) in time complexity. It also uses a stack to store the opening brackets, which is efficient in terms of memory usage. The stack's size will never exceed the length of the string, making it O(n) in space complexity. This code should run efficiently on the server configuration you provided.
