Here is the Python code for the function `below_above_threshold`:

```python
def below_above_threshold(l: list, t1: int, t2: int, s: str):
    if s == 'below':
        for i, num in enumerate(l):
            if num >= t1:
                return i
        return True
    elif s == 'above':
        for i, num in enumerate(l):
            if num <= t2:
                return i
        return True
    else:
        return -1
```

This function uses a simple loop to iterate over the list of numbers. If the condition specified by the string `s` is not met for a number, it returns the index of that number. If all numbers meet the condition, it returns `True`. If `s` is neither 'below' nor 'above', it returns `-1`.

This code is efficient because it stops checking as soon as it finds a number that doesn't meet the condition, so it doesn't do unnecessary work. It also uses the built-in `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each number in the list, which is more efficient than using an index to access the list elements.
