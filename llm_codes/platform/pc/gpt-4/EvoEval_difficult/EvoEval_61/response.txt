Here is the Python code for the function `correct_bracketing_advanced`. This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks the top of the stack and if the opening bracket of the same type is found, it pops it from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means all brackets are correctly nested and matched.

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    bracket_map = {"(": ")", "{": "}", "[": "]"}
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in bracket_map:
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif len(stack) == 0 or bracket != bracket_map[stack.pop()]:
            return False
    return len(stack) == 0
```

This code is efficient because it only traverses the string once, making it O(n) in time complexity. It also uses a stack to store the opening brackets, which is efficient in terms of memory usage. The stack operations (push and pop) are O(1) in time complexity. 

This code should run efficiently on your PC with Intel Core i9-13900KF processor, Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU, and 64 GB RAM running Ubuntu 24.04. The code does not use any specific hardware features, so it should run well on any general-purpose computer.
