Here is the Python code for the function `decimal_to_binary(decimal, padding_length)`:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal, padding_length):
    # Check if the inputs are valid
    if not isinstance(decimal, int) or not isinstance(padding_length, int) or decimal < 0 or padding_length < 0:
        return "Invalid Input"

    # Convert the decimal number to binary
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]

    # Check if the binary representation is longer than the padding_length
    if len(binary) > padding_length:
        return "Padding length is too small"

    # Pad the binary number with '0's at the beginning to reach the required 'padding_length'
    binary = binary.zfill(padding_length)

    # Add the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string
    binary = "db" + binary + "db"

    return binary
```

This function first checks if the inputs are valid. If not, it returns an error message. Then it converts the decimal number to binary and checks if the binary representation is longer than the padding_length. If it is, it returns an error message. If not, it pads the binary number with '0's at the beginning to reach the required 'padding_length' and adds the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string. Finally, it returns the binary string.
