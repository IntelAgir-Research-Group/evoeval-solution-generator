Here is the completed code for the `weighted_mean_absolute_deviation` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple


def weighted_mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[Tuple[float, float]]) -> float:
    total_weight = sum(w for _, w in numbers)
    
    if total_weight != 1 or any(w <= 0 for _, w in numbers):
        return "Weights must be positive and sum to 1"
    
    weighted_mean = sum(x * w for x, w in numbers)
    wmad = sum(w * abs(x - weighted_mean) for x, w in numbers) / total_weight
    
    return wmad


# Test the function
print(weighted_mean_absolute_deviation([(1.0, 0.1), (2.0, 0.2), (3.0, 0.3), (4.0, 0.4)]))  # Output should be 0.8
```

This code calculates the Weighted Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of tuples as described in the function docstring. It checks if the weights are positive and sum to 1 before performing the calculation. The completed function includes the calculation logic and the necessary checks.
