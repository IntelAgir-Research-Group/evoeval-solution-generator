Here is the completed code for the `weighted_mean_absolute_deviation` function:

```python
def weighted_mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[Tuple[float, float]]) -> float:
    total_weight = sum(w for _, w in numbers)
    
    if total_weight != 1 or any(w <= 0 for _, w in numbers):
        return "Weights must be positive and sum to 1"
    
    weighted_mean = sum(x * w for x, w in numbers)
    wmad = sum(w * abs(x - weighted_mean) for x, w in numbers) / total_weight
    
    return wmad

# Test the function
print(weighted_mean_absolute_deviation([(1.0, 0.1), (2.0, 0.2), (3.0, 0.3), (4.0, 0.4)]))
```

This code calculates the Weighted Mean Absolute Deviation for the given list of tuples. It first checks if the weights are positive and sum to 1. If not, it returns the specified message. Otherwise, it calculates the weighted mean and then the weighted mean absolute deviation as per the formula provided.
