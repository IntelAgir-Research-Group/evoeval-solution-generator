Here is the Python code that checks if the brackets in the string are correctly nested and every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type. This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks the top of the stack and if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket, it pops it from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means all brackets are correctly nested and matched.

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    bracket_map = {"(": ")", "{": "}", "[": "]"}
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in bracket_map:
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif len(stack) == 0 or bracket_map[stack.pop()] != bracket:
            return False
    return len(stack) == 0
```

This code is efficient because it only traverses the string once, so its time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. It also uses a stack to store the opening brackets, so its space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case when all characters in the string are opening brackets. This code should run efficiently on the Raspberry Pi with the given configuration.
