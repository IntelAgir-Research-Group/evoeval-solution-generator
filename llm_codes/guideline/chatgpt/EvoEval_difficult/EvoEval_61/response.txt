Here is the completed code for the `correct_bracketing_advanced` function:

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str):
    opening_brackets = "({["
    closing_brackets = ")}]"
    stack = []
    
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in opening_brackets:
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket in closing_brackets:
            if not stack:
                return False
            if opening_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != closing_brackets.index(bracket):
                return False
    
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced(")(()"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}]"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[()]}"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[(])}"))  # False
```

This code efficiently checks if the brackets are correctly nested and have corresponding opening and closing brackets of the same type. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that the closing brackets match the last opening bracket encountered.
