 Here is the Python code that completes your request:

```python
def next_smallest_and_largest(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return (None, None)

    smallest = largest = float('inf')
    second_smallest = second_largest = float('inf')

    for num in lst:
        if num < smallest:
            second_smallest, smallest = smallest, num
        elif smallest < num < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = num

        if num > largest:
            second_largest, largest = largest, num
        elif largest > num > second_largest:
            second_largest = num

    return (second_smallest if second_smallest != float('inf') else None, 
            second_largest if second_largest != float('inf') else None)
```
This function works by keeping track of the smallest and second smallest numbers as well as the largest and second largest numbers seen so far while iterating over the list. The complexity is O(n) as it makes only one pass over the list. It returns the 2nd smallest and 2nd largest numbers in the list, or None if they do not exist.
