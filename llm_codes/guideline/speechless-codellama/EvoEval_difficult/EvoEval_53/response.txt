```python
def add_elements(list1: list, list2: list, index: int):
    try:
        result = list1[index] + list2[index]
        return (result, False)
    except IndexError:
        return (None, True)
```

Explanation:

The function `add_elements` takes three arguments: `list1`, `list2`, and `index`. It tries to add the elements at the given index from both lists and returns the result along with a boolean indicating whether an exception occurred.

In the `try` block, we try to add the elements at the given index from both lists using the `+` operator. If the index is within the range of both lists, the function returns a tuple containing the result of the addition and `False` indicating that no exception occurred.

In the `except` block, we catch the `IndexError` exception that occurs when the index is out of range for one of the lists. In this case, we return a tuple containing `None` and `True` indicating that an exception occurred.
