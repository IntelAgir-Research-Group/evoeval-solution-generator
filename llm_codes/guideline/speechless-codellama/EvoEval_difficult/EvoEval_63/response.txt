```python
def customFibFib(n: int, startSequence: list, p: int):
    if n == 0:
        return startSequence[0]
    elif n == 1:
        return startSequence[1]
    elif n == 2:
        return startSequence[2]
    else:
        a, b, c = startSequence
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            a, b, c = b, c, a+b+c
            if c > p:
                return 'Limit Exceeded'
        return c
```

Explanation:

The function first checks if `n` is 0, 1, or 2, and returns the corresponding value from `startSequence`. If `n` is greater than 2, it initializes `a`, `b`, and `c` to the first three values in `startSequence`. Then, it enters a loop that starts at 3 and goes up to `n`. In each iteration of the loop, it updates `a`, `b`, and `c` to the next three values in the sequence. If `c` exceeds `p`, it immediately returns 'Limit Exceeded'. Finally, it returns `c` as the n-th element of the sequence.
