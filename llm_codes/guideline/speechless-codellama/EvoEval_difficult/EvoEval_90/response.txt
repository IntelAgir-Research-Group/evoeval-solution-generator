Here's the code that meets the requirements:

```python
def next_smallest_and_largest(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return (None, None)
    
    smallest = largest = None
    smallest_count = largest_count = 0
    
    for num in lst:
        if smallest is None or num < smallest:
            smallest = num
            smallest_count = 1
        elif num == smallest:
            smallest_count += 1
        
        if largest is None or num > largest:
            largest = num
            largest_count = 1
        elif num == largest:
            largest_count += 1
    
    if smallest_count > 1 or largest_count > 1:
        return (None, None)
    
    return (smallest, largest)
```

Explanation:

1. We first check if the list is empty or has only one element. If so, we return `(None, None)` as there is no second smallest or largest element.

2. We initialize `smallest` and `largest` to `None` and `smallest_count` and `largest_count` to 0.

3. We iterate through the list and update `smallest` and `largest` if we find a smaller or larger number. We also update the count of the smallest and largest numbers.

4. If we find more than one occurrence of the smallest or largest number, we return `(None, None)` as there is no second smallest or largest element.

5. Otherwise, we return the tuple of the smallest and largest numbers.
