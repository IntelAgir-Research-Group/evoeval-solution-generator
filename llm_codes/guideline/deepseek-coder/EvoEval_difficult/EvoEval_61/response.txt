To implement the `correct_bracketing_advanced` function efficiently, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. This allows us to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type and that the brackets are correctly nested.

Here's the optimized implementation:

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    brackets is a string comprising "(", ")", "{", "}", "[", "]".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type and is correctly nested. 
    The bracket types must not intersect with one another.
    """
    # Dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in brackets:
        if char in matching_bracket.values():
            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_bracket:
            # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack
            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
    
    # If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched correctly
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("("))        # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("()"))       # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("(()())"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced(")(()"))     # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}]"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}"))    # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[()]}"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[(])}"))   # False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Matching Brackets Dictionary**: We use a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. This helps in quickly checking if a closing bracket matches the last opened bracket.
2. **Stack Data Structure**: We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the top of the stack.
3. **Efficient Iteration**: We iterate through the string once, ensuring a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
4. **Early Termination**: If at any point a closing bracket does not match the top of the stack, we return `False` immediately, avoiding unnecessary computations.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched correctly. If not, there are unmatched opening brackets.

This implementation is efficient in terms of both time and space, adhering to the guidelines provided.
