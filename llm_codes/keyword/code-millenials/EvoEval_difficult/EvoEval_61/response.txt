 Here is a Python solution using a stack data structure:

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str):
    stack = []
    opening_brackets = "({["
    closing_brackets = ")}]"
    bracket_pairs = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in opening_brackets:
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket in closing_brackets:
            if not stack or stack[-1] != bracket_pairs[bracket]:
                return False
            stack.pop()

    return not stack

print(correct_bracketing_advanced("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced(")(()"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}]"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[()]}"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[(])}"))  # False
```

This solution works by iterating through the input string and treating each bracket as either an opening or closing bracket. Opening brackets are added to the stack, while closing brackets must match the last added opening bracket. If a closing bracket doesn't match the last added opening bracket, or if there are any remaining opening brackets in the stack after iterating through the entire string, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
