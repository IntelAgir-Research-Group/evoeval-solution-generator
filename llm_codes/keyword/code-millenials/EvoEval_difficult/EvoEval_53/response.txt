 Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def add_elements(list1: list, list2: list, index: int):
    try:
        return list1[index] + list2[index], False
    except IndexError:
        return None, True
```

This function tries to add the elements at the specified index in both lists. If the index is out of range for one of the lists, an `IndexError` is raised, which we catch and return `None` as the addition result, and `True` as the boolean indicating that an exception occurred. If no exception occurs, we return the addition result and `False`.

Please note that the Python list indexing starts from 0. So, if you want to add the first elements of each list, you should pass 0 as the index.
