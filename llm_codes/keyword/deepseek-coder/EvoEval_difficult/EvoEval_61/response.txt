To create an energy-efficient function that checks if the brackets are correctly nested and matched, we can use a stack data structure. This approach ensures that we only traverse the string once, making it both time and space efficient.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    brackets is a string comprising "(", ")", "{", "}", "[", "]".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type and is correctly nested. 
    The bracket types must not intersect with one another.
    """
    # Dictionary to hold the matching pairs of brackets
    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in matching_bracket.values():
            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket in matching_bracket:
            # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack
            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[bracket] != stack.pop():
                return False
        else:
            # If the character is not a bracket, return False
            return False
    
    # If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched correctly
    return stack == []

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("("))        # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("()"))       # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("(()())"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced(")(()"))     # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}]"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}"))    # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[()]}"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[(])}"))   # False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Matching Brackets Dictionary**: We use a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
2. **Stack**: We use a list as a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
3. **Iteration**: We iterate through each character in the input string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket, we check if it matches the top of the stack. If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, we return `False`.
4. **Final Check**: After the loop, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched correctly, so we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that the function runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string, and uses O(n) space complexity in the worst case (when all characters are opening brackets).
