Here is the Python code that fulfills your requirements:

```python
def below_above_threshold(l: list, t1: int, t2: int, s: str):
    if s == 'below':
        for i, num in enumerate(l):
            if num >= t1:
                return i
        return True
    elif s == 'above':
        for i, num in enumerate(l):
            if num <= t2:
                return i
        return True
    else:
        return -1
```

This function iterates over the list and checks each number against the threshold. If the number violates the condition, it immediately returns the index of that number, which makes it energy efficient as it doesn't need to check the rest of the list. If no number violates the condition, it returns True. If the string 's' is neither 'below' nor 'above', it returns -1.
