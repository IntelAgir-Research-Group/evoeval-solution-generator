Here is the code for the `next_smallest_and_largest` function that meets the energy-efficient requirements and the specified constraints:

```python
def next_smallest_and_largest(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return (None, None)

    smallest = second_smallest = float('inf')
    largest = second_largest = float('-inf')

    for num in lst:
        if num < smallest:
            second_smallest = smallest
            smallest = num
        elif num < second_smallest and num != smallest:
            second_smallest = num

        if num > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = num
        elif num > second_largest and num != largest:
            second_largest = num

    if second_smallest == float('inf') or second_largest == float('-inf'):
        return (None, None)
    else:
        return (second_smallest, second_largest)

# Test cases
print(next_smallest_and_largest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: (2, 4)
print(next_smallest_and_largest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]))  # Output: (2, 4)
print(next_smallest_and_largest([]))  # Output: (None, None)
print(next_smallest_and_largest([1, 1]))  # Output: (None, None)
print(next_smallest_and_largest([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]))  # Output: (-4, -2)
```

This code efficiently finds the 2nd smallest and 2nd largest elements in the list without sorting it, handling negative numbers and zeros as well.
