Here is the code for the `add_elements` function that is energy efficient:

```python
def add_elements(list1: list, list2: list, index: int):
    try:
        result = list1[index] + list2[index]
        exception_occurred = False
    except IndexError:
        result = None
        exception_occurred = True

    return result, exception_occurred

# Test cases
print(add_elements([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1))  # Output: (7, False)
print(add_elements([10, 20, 30], [40, 50], 2))  # Output: (None, True)
```

This code efficiently handles the addition of elements from two lists based on the provided index and properly handles exceptions when the index is out of range for one of the lists.
