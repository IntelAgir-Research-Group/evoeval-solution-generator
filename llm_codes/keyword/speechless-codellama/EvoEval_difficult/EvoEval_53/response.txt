Here's the code for the `add_elements` function that handles exceptions and is energy efficient:

```python
def add_elements(list1: list, list2: list, index: int) -> tuple:
    try:
        result = list1[index] + list2[index]
        return result, False
    except IndexError:
        return None, True
```

This function takes in two lists and an index as input, and returns a tuple where the first element is the result of the addition and the second element is a boolean indicating whether an exception occurred (True if it occurred, False otherwise).

The function uses a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur if the index is out of range for one of the lists. If no exception occurs, the function simply adds the elements at the specified index and returns the result along with a False boolean. If an exception does occur, the function returns None and a True boolean.
