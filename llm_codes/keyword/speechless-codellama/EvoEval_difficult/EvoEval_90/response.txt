Here's the code that meets the requirements you specified:

```python
def next_smallest_and_largest(lst):
    smallest = float('inf')
    second_smallest = float('inf')
    largest = float('-inf')
    second_largest = float('-inf')

    for num in lst:
        if num < smallest:
            second_smallest = smallest
            smallest = num
        elif num < second_smallest and num != smallest:
            second_smallest = num

        if num > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = num
        elif num > second_largest and num != largest:
            second_largest = num

    if smallest == float('inf') or second_smallest == float('inf') or largest == float('-inf') or second_largest == float('-inf'):
        return (None, None)
    else:
        return (second_smallest, second_largest)
```

This function iterates through the list once and keeps track of the smallest, second smallest, largest, and second largest elements. It then returns a tuple of the second smallest and second largest elements, or None if there are not enough unique elements in the list.
